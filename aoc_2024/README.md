# Advent of Code 2024

My solutions for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenges. Each day's solution is organized in its own directory with the corresponding Python implementation and input files

## ‚ú® About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. Each day in December, a new puzzle is released, consisting of two parts. Solving both parts earns you two gold stars.
